lxd (2.0.0~rc8-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Switch from lxcbr0 to lxdbr0.
    - Show upgrade warning telling users to configure lxdbr0.
    - Force re-application of the bridge settings to move everyone off lxcbr0.
    - Drop dependency on lxc (no longer needed).
    - Properly stop/start the lxd bridge during reconfigure on systemd systems.
    - Remove compatibility code.
    - Add more details to existing debconf templates.
    - Fix typo in cidr function name.
    - Don't parse an empty netmask as a CIDR mask of 0.
    - Fix logic when disabling IPv4 or IPv6 networking.
    - Print a warning message about LXD networking from postinst.
    - Make the tests depend on lxc1 (upstream testsuite uses lxcbr0)
    - Cherry-pick lxd-bridge fixes from upstream:
      + lxd-bridge-proxy: Bump port number to 13128
      + Run lxd-bridge's dnsmasq as the lxd user
      + lxd-bridge: Don't set link-local without a proxy
    - Apply distro patch:
      + Have lxd init offer to call dpkg-reconfigure

    The reason for the switch away from lxcbr0 is to avoid masking the
    10.0.3.0/24 subnet on a whole lot of Ubuntu systems which may not even
    be using containers.

    The new bridge provides basic http connectivity through a proxy out
    of the box and requires manual configuration for anything else.

    To reconfigure the bridge, run: dpkg-reconfigure lxd

  * Bump standard to 3.9.7, no change required.
  * Update systemd unit to not limit the number of threads.
  * Switch to archive copies of:
    - golang-gopkg-flosch-pongo2.v3-dev
    - golang-gopkg-inconshreveable-log15.v2-dev
  * Fix new lintian warnings:

lxd (2.0.0~rc6-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Turn on lxdbr0. This upload enables the debconf questions for lxdbr0
    as well as the needed init scripts and handlers.

    It however does NOT change the default bridge over BY DEFAULT.
    The default bridge will only be switched to lxdbr0 if the user
    manually edits /etc/default/lxd-bridge or runs "dpkg-reconfigure lxd".

    This is a temporary setup to allow all downstreams to adjust for the
    new world where the lxdbr0 bridge comes with a link-local address only
    and requires configuration.

    Once we are satisfied those downstreams have updated their code to
    support this new bridge, we will remove the dependency on the "lxc1"
    package and switch everyone over to the lxdbr0 with a suitable
    upgrade-only warning and initial debconf run (so users can minimize the
    impact of the switch).

    This change includes:
     - Introduce debconf configuration script to generate
       /etc/default/lxd-bridge
     - New lxd-bridge.service systemd unit
     - New update-profile and lxd-bridge.start helper scripts, used to
       only apply LXD configuration changes when needed.
     - Update to the sysvinit and upstart jobs to run the needed
       scripts. Those two "legacy" init systems do not get the full treatment
       of a separate init script for the bridge, but do get all the features
       nevertheless.
  * Fix lxd.service start condition to start after lxc-net.service
    rather than lxc.service.
